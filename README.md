### What are your key takeaways from this exercise?

This exercise has reminded me how tedious it is to create web pages using HTML and CSS. Since errors are not easily detected, it really forced me to be more mindful and careful as I was making my website portfolio. I recalled my first encounter with HTML and CSS, and I remember not really being able to understand how to use them well. Fortunately, this time round, I'm able to grasp and understand them and their (possible) uses better. I also realized that creativity matters just as much as logical thinking does when creating these web pages/sites.
