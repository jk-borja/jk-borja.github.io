                    Julia's experience with web programming is not that extensive yet, however, she is well-versed with <i>Python, HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript</i>, along with other more programming languages. She is also a quick learner and is always open to learn and try new
                    things out. She is proactive and cooperative when working with a team, and also possesses good leadership qualities, authority, and empathy.
                    <br/><br/>
                    One of her most notable characteristics that is relevant to web programming is her creativity, which seems to be an
                    ideal trait for a Frontend Software Engineer to have as they deal with what users see and interact with.

                <p class="about_me">
                    Julia was born and raised in Quezon City, but currently resides in Los Ba√±os, Laguna for her studies.
                    She previously studied under the STEM strand at the <i>Holy Spirit School, Ilang-Ilang</i> and graduated 12th grade at
                    <i>Ramon Magsaysay (Cubao) High School</i> in 2021.
                    <br/><br/>
                    She took the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree program at the University of the Philippines Los Banos under
                    the advise of several trusted people in her life, but she has always had more of an affinity for the arts. In her journey
                    as a BS Computer Science student, her interest in the arts has helped her become more innovative and explorative
                    with her approach in dealing with her work.
